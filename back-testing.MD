# Back testing

DigiCap bot provides ability to perform on the fly tests on recent trade data.

## On-the-fly back testing

Users can perform on the fly testing as they are creating new strategies. This allows them to optimise their strategy before making any actual trades.

*On-the-fly* testing is based on:
* last 6h of trade data
* purchasing $1000 worth of the asset currency e.g. if asset pair is *BTC/USD* the results will be based on the user purchasing $1000 worth of Bitcoin
